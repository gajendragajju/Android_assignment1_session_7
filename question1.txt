question-1)What is the use of SQLite open helper class in SQLite?

answer:-)You create a subclass implementing onCreate(SQLiteDatabase), 
onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase, int, int) and optionally onOpen(SQLiteDatabase),
 and this class takes care of opening the database if it exists, creating it if it does not, and upgrading it as necessary. 
Transactions are used to make sure the database is always in a sensible state.This class makes it easy for ContentProvider 
implementations to defer opening and upgrading the database until first use, 
to avoid blocking application startup with long-running database upgrades.
For maximum control over local data, developers can use SQLite directly by 
leveraging SQLiteOpenHelper for executing SQL requests and managing a local database.

1)SQLiteOpenHelper

SQLiteOpenHelper(Context context,String name, SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory factory,int version,DatabaseErrorHandler errorHandler)
Create a helper object to create, open, and/or manage a database. 
The database is not actually created or opened until one of getWritableDatabase() or getReadableDatabase() is called.

2)getReadableDatabase


SQLiteDatabase getReadableDatabase ()
Create and/or open a database. This will be the same object returned by getWritableDatabase() unless some problem, 
such as a full disk, requires the database to be opened read-only. In that case, a read-only database object will be returned.
 If the problem is fixed, a future call to getWritableDatabase() may succeed, in which case the read-only database object will be 
closed and the read/write object will be returned in the future.
